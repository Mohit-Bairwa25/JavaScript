<!-- 
A Promise in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It serves as a placeholder for the eventual results of the operation. It’s a way to handle asynchronous operations without getting into callback hell.

The .then() method is a crucial part of working with promises in JavaScript. It’s used to schedule actions to be performed when the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

.then() is a method that takes up to two arguments: callback functions for the success and failure cases of the promise.
The first argument is a callback function that’s executed when the promise is resolved, and receives the result of the promise as its argument.
The second argument (which is often omitted) is a callback function that’s executed when the promise is rejected, and receives the reason for rejection as its argument.

The .catch() method in JavaScript is used with Promises to handle errors. It’s a method that gets invoked when a Promise is rejected or an error is thrown in a Promise chain. It’s a cleaner and more readable alternative to passing a second callback function to .then().
